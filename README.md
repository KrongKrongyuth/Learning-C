# Learning C Programming repository tracking.
## This repository is used for tracking my learning process.
I start learning C Programming on 25 Dec 2023 and will write down the summary of the learning process every day(look like little my little diary) starting with this day.

***25 Dec 2023:*** On this day I'm start learning the basic concept of C Programing like Basic Structure, Datatype, Basic Functions (printf(), scanf(), fgets(), etc.), Format Specifiers and Constants, Arithmetic Operators, IF Statement and Switch Statement. On this day I had already done 5 project in C even though there was a very simple project it taught me to apply the knowledge that I have learned today to make something.

***26 Dec 2023:*** This day I've learned about Logical Operators, Functions, Loop(For and While also Do_While), and Arrays. So I will tell the truth structure of C programming is harder than I think, not because it is hard to understand but because it is hard to remember. The structure of C is very detailed when I need to create a Function I need to declare what is the type of value that will return from this function such as I must use "void()" when I need to return all of the results from the function, use "int()" when I need to return integers from the function, etc. Moreover "Arrays" in C need to focus on the number of data that you need to store in the array from Python user is very hard to think what is the total number of data that I need to store because usually i spend most of the time with thinking about algorithm but in C I need to spend time to thinking about the size of the array and more (even the length of array in C we must calculate it by using sizeof(Arrays)/sizeof(Arrays[0]) T-T), so it hard to get used to it in soon. But I will try my best :)
