# Learning C Programming repository tracking.
## This repository is used for tracking my learning process.
I start learning C Programming on 25 Dec 2023 and will write down the summary of the learning process every day(look like little my little diary) starting with this day.

25 Dec 2023: On this day I'm start learning the basic concept of C Programing like Basic Structure, Datatype, Basic Functions (printf(), scanf(), fgets(), etc.), Format Specifiers and Constants, Arithmetic Operators, IF Statement and Switch Statement. On this day I had already done 5 project in C even though there was a very simple project it taught me to apply the knowledge that I have learned today to make something.
